# Robot Temperature Controller
Setup and usage instructions

## Setup & Assumptions
Use the package manager pip to install foobar. Python v3.7.3
```bash
pip install datetime matplotlib

```

## Usage
### Data Generator
```bash
python dataGenerator.py

```
Note: Need to enter the number of subsystems in robot as input and assuming that the robot has three fans.
Also, the temperature values from the all subsystems are randomly generated floating values between 0 to 100 C in file livedata.txt and those values are feeded to control the maximum fan speed. The temperature values are stored in output.txt. The adjusted maximum fan speed values are added to the table in output.csv.

### Plot
```bash
python plot.py

```
Reads output.csv every three seconds and plot live data. Code is written to handle Maximum speed percentage, maximum temperatuire reading out of all subsystems and time while reading temperature values.


Note: Both scripts can be ran at the same time, but plot.py uses the output generated by dataGenerator.py.
